I specialize in hardware engineering, focusing on embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Over the past year, I have gained valuable experience as a Hardware Engineer, honing my skills in designing and implementing cutting-edge hardware solutions.

Until then, I'd like to share my interests. I have a deep appreciation for music, cinema, and literature, finding immense joy and inspiration in these exquisite art forms that enrich the human experience. Here are three of my personal favorites:
